# Agenda

School award management software, made simple. With **Agenda** you are able to assign awards to students for each class. Superusers are then able to see the award distribution among students and then submit for printing. 

## Files

**Agenda** stores files on a local server, allowing for an institution to manage their files according to their needs and requirements.

## Usage

When connected to an Agentibus hosting network, assessing https://localhost:3000 will direct you to the login screen.
